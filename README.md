### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is a tricky one to get right for responsiveness...

No help on this one... no looking up solutions or copying at all, so pretty pleased, (although it did take a couple of hours longer than it should)

### Continued development

Need to continue to practice use of flex / grid to ease my understanding of layout challenges.
